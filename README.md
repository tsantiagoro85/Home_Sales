# Home_Sales

In this challenge, SparkSQL was used to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then, Spark was used to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

The repo contains the code in Home_Sales.ipynb, and the following questions were answered:
